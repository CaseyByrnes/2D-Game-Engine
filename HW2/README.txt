INSTRUCTIONS:
For Homework 2, each part is in it's own subfolder, except for parts 1 and 2 which are in the same folder.  The keyboard controls as well as the instructions
for compiling and running each part are listed below.

KEYBOARD CONTROLS:
Move left: "A"
Move right: "D"
Jump: "Spacebar"
Sprint: "Left Shift"
Pause/Unpause: "P"

Adjust timing: "T" +
    0.5 Time: "1"
    1.0 Time: "2"
    2.0 Time: "3"


*********** PARTS 1-2 ***********
Navigate to the "Parts_1-2" folder and compile using the Makefile included with the project in the HW2 folder. (The Makefile is the example Makefile given to 
the class with some modifications.)

Once compiled, run using "./main" in terminal.

*********** PART 3 ***********
Navigate to the "Part_3" folder:

Server:
To compile the server, navigate to the "server" folder and compile it using the Makefile included in that folder.
Once compiled, run using "./main" in terminal. The default port used for the server is port# 5567, if you change this
in the server.cpp file, ensure that you also change it in the client. 
**The server currently only supports up to 9 clients!**

Client:
To compile the client, navigate to the "client" folder and compile it using the Makefile included in that folder.
Once compiled, run using "./main" in terminal. The default port used for the server is port# 5567, if you change this in
the serverfile, ensure that you also change it in the client.cpp file. 
**The server currently only supports up to 9 clients!**

*********** PART 4 ***********
Navigate to the "Part_4" folder:

Server:
To compile the server, navigate to the "HW2Server" folder and compile it using the Makefile included in that folder.
Once compiled, run using "./main" in terminal. The default ports used for the server are port# 5560 and port# 5561.

Client:
To compile the client, navigate to the "HW2Client" folder and compile it using the Makefile included in that folder.
Once compiled, run using "./main" in terminal. The default ports used for the server are port# 5560 and port# 5561.
